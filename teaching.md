### Roles
- **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant — MATH 447: Machine Learning (USC)**
  - Led review sessions and office hours on model evaluation, regularization, and ensemble methods (e.g., AdaBoost).
  - Designed small coding exercises to connect theory (risk minimization, bias–variance) with practice.

- **Grader — MATH 245: Vector Calculus (USC)**
  - Three semesters supporting problem-solving techniques, Jacobians, and line/surface integrals.

### Favorite Mini-Lessons
- **“Two Convolutions”** — LTI system output vs. PDF of sums of RVs: same operator, different semantics.
- **“When Regularization Helps”** — why L2 can improve generalization even when training loss increases.

*Office hours by request. I enjoy working with students on intuition and structure before computation.*
