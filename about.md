Hi! My name is **Justin Liu**. I’m a researcher focused on multi-agent reinforcement learning,
Eisenberg–Gale market-based task allocation, diffusion-based state estimation, and embodied AI safety.

I completed dual B.S. degrees in **Electrical & Computer Engineering (Honors)** and **Applied & Computational Mathematics** at the **University of Southern California** in May 2025.  
I work with the **[Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/)** advised by Prof. **Bhaskar Krishnamachari**.

**Interests**
- EG-MARL: Fair, efficient task allocation via competitive equilibrium.
- Diffusion for dynamics/state estimation under partial observability.
- Embodied AI safety (AI2-THOR / VirtualHome): constraint-aware planning and verification.
- Wildfire modeling and geolocation.

**News**
- [2024] Paper accepted at IEEE SiPS: *Let’s Roll: A Synthetic and Real Dataset for Pedestrian Detection Across Different Shutter Types*.
- [Recent] Building a Hydejack personal site :)
