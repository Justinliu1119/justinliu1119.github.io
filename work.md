### Researcher — Autonomous Networks Research Group (USC)
Working with **Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari** on market-based multi-agent coordination and learning under uncertainty.  
- Built EG-MARL framework for fair/efficient task allocation; studied online updates and robustness.
- Prototyped diffusion-based state estimators for partially observed control.

### Selected Project Work — USC
- **Wildfire Modeling:** spatiotemporal prediction and visualization; explored fusion of multi-modal sensing for ignition/arrival-time estimation.
- **Embodied AI Safety:** constraint-aware planning in simulated environments (AI2-THOR / VirtualHome).

### Publications (short)
- *Let’s Roll: A Synthetic and Real Dataset for Pedestrian Detection Across Different Shutter Types.* **IEEE SiPS 2024**.
