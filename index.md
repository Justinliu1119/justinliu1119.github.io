## About {#about}
Hi! My name is **Justin Liu**. I completed dual B.S. degrees in **Electrical & Computer Engineering (Honors)** and
**Applied & Computational Mathematics** at the **University of Southern California** in May 2025.
I’m a researcher in the **[Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/)** advised by Prof. **Bhaskar Krishnamachari**.

I’m broadly interested in robotic learning and control, especially building autonomous systems that navigate complex
environments and perform long-horizon tasks efficiently **and safely**. Current directions include **market-based task
allocation for multi-robot systems (EG-MARL)**, **diffusion-based state estimation**, and **safety-aware planning** for
embodied agents.

**Focus areas**
- **EG-MARL** — competitive-equilibrium task allocation with fairness–efficiency trade-offs.
- **Diffusion state estimation** — robust policies under partial observability.
- **Embodied AI safety** — constraint-aware planning (AI2-THOR / VirtualHome).
- **Wildfire modeling** — spatiotemporal prediction & geolocation.

See my **[CV](/assets/pdf/Yao_Liu_CV.pdf)** for details.

## Research {#research}
### EG-MARL
Multi-robot task allocation as a **competitive-equilibrium market**.
Budgets encode fairness, utilities capture heterogeneity, and the equilibrium yields **efficient** and **fair** assignments.
Comparisons vs. Hungarian/greedy; CTDE training and online replanning.
- Repo: <https://github.com/Justinliu1119/Fair-MARL>

### Diffusion-based State Estimation
For partially observed dynamics, use **conditional diffusion models** to impute latent states and missing observations, improving policy robustness.

### Embodied AI Safety
In interactive simulators (AI2-THOR / VirtualHome), combine **LLM-assisted planning** with **constraint checks** (temporal-logic style) to keep policies safe while maintaining task success.

### Wildfire Modeling
Spatiotemporal forecasting and geolocation with multi-modal sensing; estimating ignition/arrival-time maps.
