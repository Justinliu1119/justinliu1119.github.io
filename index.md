Hi! My name is **Justin Liu**. I completed dual B.S. degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Honors) and
Applied & Computational Mathematics at the **University of Southern California** in May 2025.
I’m a researcher in the **[Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/)** advised by Prof. **Bhaskar Krishnamachari**.

I’m broadly interested in robotic learning and control. I’m fascinated by building autonomous systems that
navigate complex environments and perform long-horizon tasks efficiently and safely. My current work explores
market-based task allocation for multi-robot systems, diffusion-based state estimation, and safety-aware planning
for embodied agents.

**Focus areas**
- **EG-MARL** — competitive-equilibrium task allocation with fairness–efficiency trade-offs.
- **Diffusion state estimation** — robust policies under partial observability.
- **Embodied AI safety** — constraint-aware planning (AI2-THOR / VirtualHome).
- **Wildfire modeling** — spatiotemporal prediction & geolocation.

See my **[About](/about/)** page for details and my **[CV](/assets/pdf/Yao_Liu_CV.pdf)**.
